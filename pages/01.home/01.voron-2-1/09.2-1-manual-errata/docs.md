# Topics
## FSR
* Note that the FSR pad comes with a glue film on the back and should be glued to the base. Remove the protection film from the back, it is very thin. Be careful not to damage the pressure pad!
## Panels:
* Panel dimensions are different if you compare manual and BOM. BOM is correct on outer dimensions!
* Z chain hole in the bottom panel in 350 configuration is under the front-to-back extrusion holding the bed. Cut according to your cable management!
## Screw lengths:
Some screw length may be wrong:
* Use M2x10 for the x/y endstop
* Use M5x12 to attach Mobius 2/3
## Missing screw hole in side skirts
The side skirts do not have a hole in the middle for bottom panel attachement. Just add one with your tool of choice.
